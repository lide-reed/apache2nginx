The APR DBD Driver for FreeTDS has been removed from the build.
It is known to have problems, and we are not able to maintain it.

The source code is still available.  If you want it and are able
to manage maintenance for yourself, you can patch the build and
work through issues that affect you, but you're on your own.

We expect that for most users, the ODBC driver will serve as
an alternative.

Sorry.
